# AI Agent Toolkit

Welcome to your new AI-powered development studio. This toolkit turns your coding assistant into a team of specialized experts.

## 🚀 What is this?
It's a "brain upgrade" for your AI. Instead of just one AI helper, you get a full team:
- **Frontend Architect**: For beautiful UIs.
- **Backend Expert**: For robust servers and databases.
- **Media Specialist**: For image processing and background removal.
- **Release Engineer**: For packaging your apps into `.exe` files.

## 📦 What's Inside?
- **18 Specialist Agents**: Experts in different fields.
- **Improved Workflows**: Simple slash commands like `/create`, `/fix`, or `/deploy` to get things done.
- **Integrated Tools**:
  - **Background Remover**: Professional quality image processing.
  - **Portable App Kit**: Turn your web apps into standalone Windows apps.
  - **Coding Utilities**: Advanced developer tools.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Setup
Runs checks and installs what you need:
```bash
python kit.py setup
```

### 2. Use a Workflow
Ask your AI to run a workflow:
- **`/create`** - Build a new app from scratch.
- **`/remove-background`** - Clean up images.
- **`/build-portable-app`** - Make an `.exe` file.
